# Talltale
A quick `read`, `echo`, and `sed` test.

### Got bored, made this, don't judge me ಠ_ಠ
I felt like making something while on my way to a cabin in the woods (spoopy, amiright?). I was supposed to be working on stuff for [AFA CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org), but I didn't have WiFi so I couldn't look stuff up. Talltale was the result.

### What it does
Talltale creates a little story with input from you, kind of like a Mad Lib book. It creates both a text file and an M4A file containing the story read by `say`. Whoop-di-doo.
